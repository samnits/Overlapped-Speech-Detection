# Overlapped-Speech-Detection
This is machine learning project including deep learning for overlap  speech detection

# Merging Procedure

started the learning with basic knowledge of feature extraction of audio samples using librosa library
and generation of dataset for overlapped and non overlapped using two audio files 

file : merging.ipynb

# Dataset Creatiion Using Stereo Audio File
here take two stereo audio files and using their dominant channels dataset for overlap and non overlap samples are created 
file : streo.ipynb

# Data Set  Generation Using Files From Grid Corpus
